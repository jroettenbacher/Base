# LIMRAD94 Sensitivtiy Limit

During EUREC4A 4 different chirp tables were used. For the three most important ones the mean sensitivity limit for the whole duration of use is plotted. The data is filtered for rain and only non rainy profiles are used for the calculation of the mean sensitivtiy limit. The difference between filtered and unfiltered is also shown.

#### Unfiltered Sensitivity Limit

#### Rain filtered Sensitivity Limit

#### Difference between filtered and unfiltered sensitivity limit

Up to -6 dBZ difference can be observed between the filtered and the unfiltered sensitivity limits. Thus it can be said, that the sensitvity limit in non rainy conditions is lower, meaning more negative, than in rainy conditions.  

Chirptable Cu_small_Tint does not show any difference because it wasn't raining during its operation period. The different polarization channels also show different sensitivity changes due to rain. The vertical channel seems to be more effected than the horizontal channel.
